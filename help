SYNOPSIS
   Generate particle-induced background spectral model for the Chandra ACIS (I0-I3 and S1-S3).

SYNTAX
   mkacispback <input event file (with selection expressions)> (options)


DESCRIPTION
"mkacispback": generate particle-induced background spectral model for input event file and region.

The output spectral model "acispback" (default) will be generated in a directory "acispback" (default).
In order to load the output spectral model in XSPEC, use "lmod" command:

	XSPEC> lmod acispback_pkg ./acispback   # default. Note that "./" is required.
	XSPEC> lmod <model name>_pkg ./<dir. name>   # if you assign a model and directory name

then you can load the model as

	XSPEC> model acispback   # dafault
	XSPEC> model <model name>   # if you assign a model name

We recommend users to use the output spectral model with a free normalization when fitting the data in case that the sky emission contaminates in the 9.0-11.5 keV energy range.

OPTIONS:
outdir=[directory name]: If provided, output directory name can be specified. default: acispback.
name=[output model name]: If provided, output model name can be specified. As required by XSPEC, this name must consists of lower letters (a-z) and/or underscores (_). It must not include numbers! default: acispback.
genrmf=[yes|no]: Generate response matrix or not. default: yes.
rmffile=[file name]: If provided, rmf file will not be newly created. The energy grid of the output spectral model will be the same as the rmf file. If "genrmf=no" and rmffile is not provided, it tries to use "temp.rmf" in the output directory.
genspec=[yes|no]: Generate energy spectrum or use already existing file. default: yes.
specfile=[file name]: If provided, spectral file will not be newly created. If "genspec=no" and specfile is not provided, it tries to use "temp_spec.pi".
egrid=[number (keV)]: Energy grid of output spectral model. default: 0.05.
emin=[integer (eV)]: Lower energy bound for calculation of weight maps and spectral fit. default: 9000.
emax=[integer (eV)]: Upper energy bound for calculation of weight maps and spectral fit. default: 115000.
gainfit=[yes|no]: Fit generated spectral model to the input data with/without free gain slope & offset. default: yes.
normfit=[yes|no]: If adjustment of the normalization of output spectral model is performed or not. default: yes.
plot=[yes|no]: Plot the spectral fit window or not. default: yes.
fakeevt=[yes|no]: Create fake event files or not. Primarily for the case with very small counts in the region of interest. default: no.
clean=[yes|no]: Remove temporary files including .pi and .rmf files. default: no.
clobber=[yes|no]: Overwrite existing files or not. default: no.


EXAMPLE:
$ mkacispback "acisf00000_evt2.fits.gz[sky=region(source.reg)]" outdir=pback-source name=pb_src_one
Particle-induced background spectral model named "pb_src_one" for the sky region "source.reg" will be gerenated in the directory "pback-source". Weight map, data spectrum and response matrix will be generated.

$ mkacispback "acisf00000_evt2.fits.gz[sky=region(source.reg)]" outdir=pback-source name=pb_src_one rmffile=input.rmf specfile=input.pi plot=no
RMF and spectral files "input.rmf" and "input.pi" are used and new RMF and spectral files will not be created. XSPEC window with the spectrum and model will not appear.
